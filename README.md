**The Problem:**

Write a tkinter program to provide a simple paint tool to create simple graphics. 
The code should be developed using OOP, exceptions and other features that we examined during the module.
The application should consist of two areas - a series of buttons and labels on the left hand side and a canvas graphics area on the right hand side. 
Two distinct groups of buttons should exist. The first should allow the user to select a fill colour - red, blue or yellow. 
The second set of buttons should allow a user to select a shape - a line, rectangle or oval.  
Two labels should show the current selectionOnce the user has selected a colour and shape, they should be able to click on the canvas to define a corner and and a second time to define a second (opposite corner) for drawing an oval or rectangle. 
Your code should be able to derive a top left and bottom right corner from these values. 
In the case of a line, the two points should define the start and end of the line - no adjustment is required in this case.

**Tasks:**
1. Develop the script and upload the completed script to the Assignment 2 submission space on Canvas.
